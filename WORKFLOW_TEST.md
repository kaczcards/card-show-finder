# Workflow Test

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-01 T00:00 UTC

This commit is intentionally created to verify that all automated pipelines are executed correctly.

## Workflows Triggered
1. **CI Pipeline**  
2. **Continuous Deployment**  
3. **Security Scanning**

## Notes
- This is a safe test commit and introduces **no functional changes** to the application.

### What Each Pipeline Covers
- **CI Pipeline:** Runs linting, TypeScript type-checking, unit tests, database tests, E2E tests, and build verification.  
- **Continuous Deployment:** Determines environment, validates database migrations, builds the mobile app, and handles release/OTA updates.  
- **Security Scanning:** Performs dependency vulnerability checks, secret detection, static code analysis, database security tests, and optional mobile app security scans.

When this file is pushed to `main` (or a PR targeting `main`/`develop`), the above workflows should run end-to-end, confirming the health of the full CI/CD/Security process.
