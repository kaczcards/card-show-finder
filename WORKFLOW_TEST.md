## Expected Outcomes

| Workflow  | Expected Result |

| **CI**    | All jobs (lint, type-check, unit tests, DB tests, E2E, build-verification) complete **successfully**. |
| **CD**    | Deployment jobs kick off automatically (or via tag) and finish without environment-variable errors, generating builds for iOS & Android. |
| **Security** | Static-analysis / vulnerability-scan jobs run to completion with no critical findings and overall status **pass**. |
