## 4. App Tracking Transparency & Advertising Identifiers  

• On first launch (or after reinstall) the App will request permission via Apple’s **App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** framework to access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).  
• If you decline, we will not access the IDFA and will limit ourselves to Apple-provided SKAdNetwork attribution.  
• You can change your choice anytime in iOS **Settings › Privacy & Security › Tracking**.  
• We do **not** combine IDFA data with precise location, contact info, or other personal identifiers for cross-app advertising.

## 5. Data Retention & Security  

• Account, transaction, and show-related data are retained while your account is active and for up to **5 years** after deletion to meet legal and audit obligations, after which it is securely erased or anonymized.  
• Crash logs in Sentry are retained for **90 days** unless needed for ongoing investigations.  
• We employ encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256 on Supabase & Stripe).  
• Access controls, two-factor authentication, and regular penetration testing safeguard our systems.
