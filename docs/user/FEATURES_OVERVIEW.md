# Features Overview

> **Status**: _Stage 1 MVP features fully implemented_  
> Later-stage items are noted where applicable.

| Feature | Summary & Benefit |
|---------|-------------------|
| **List & Map Discovery** | Browse upcoming card shows in an infinite scroll list **or** on an interactive map. The map clusters pins so crowded metros stay readable. Both views share the same filters—switch freely without losing your place. |
| **Advanced Filters** | Slice results by date range, distance radius, entry fee, categories, and special features (on-site grading, autograph guests, free parking, etc.). Spend less time scrolling and more time planning. |
| **Favorites** | Tap the ⭐ to create a personal watch-list. The app sends a push reminder 24 h before doors open, so you never miss a show. |
| **Dealer Booth Registration** | Dealers can reserve tables directly in-app. Organizers receive instant notifications and manage wait-lists in real time—no more email ping-pong. |
| **Broadcast Messaging** | Show Organizers (and MVP Dealers) send announcements to targeted audiences. Perfect for schedule changes, limited-time deals, or door-prize alerts. |
| **Profiles & Badges** | Every user has a public profile with avatar, role, and badge collection. Earn badges for attending shows, upgrading subscriptions, and leaving reviews—adding gamification and trust. |
| **Show Series** | Recurring events are grouped under a single “series” banner, making it easy to follow your favourite monthly or quarterly shows. Organizers edit the whole series in one place. |
| **Geospatial Search** | Powered by PostGIS, searches remain fast even with thousands of venues. If GPS is unavailable, the app falls back to your home ZIP code for reliable results indoors. |
| **Stripe Subscriptions** _(Stage 2)_ | Secure in-app payments unlock premium roles (MVP Dealer, Organizer analytics) and support ongoing development of the platform. |
| **Collections & Want Lists** _(Prototype)_ | Track your personal card inventory and share wish-lists with friends. Future iterations will link dealer inventory for instant match alerts. |
