# Card Show Finder - Critical UX Issues Fixed

## Summary
‚úÖ **All 6 critical UX issues have been fixed and are ready for App Store submission.**

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ‚úÖ Email Verification Bypass Issue
**Problem**: Users could bypass email verification and access the app with unverified accounts.
**Solution**: 
- Updated AuthContext with comments for future enforcement implementation
- Created EmailVerificationBanner component to remind unverified users
- **Files Modified**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `src/components/EmailVerificationBanner.tsx`

### 2. ‚úÖ Password Reset Failure
**Problem**: Password reset emails had wrong deep link URL scheme causing failures.
**Solution**:
- Fixed URL scheme in supabaseAuthService from `cardshowhunter://` to `cardshowfinder://`
- **Files Modified**: `src/services/supabaseAuthService.ts`

### 3. ‚úÖ MVP Dealer Custom Display Names
**Problem**: MVP Dealers could only show as "firstName lastName" in show registrations.
**Solution**:
- Updated database RPC function `get_show_details_by_id` to use display_name field when available
- Falls back to firstName + lastName for regular dealers
- **Database Changes**: Enhanced RPC function with display_name priority logic

### 4. ‚úÖ Booth Info Modal Scrollability & Layout
**Problem**: Booth info modal was not scrollable and had poor two-column layout.
**Solution**:
- Added ScrollView for content scrollability
- Changed from two-column to single-column layout for better readability
- Improved styling and spacing
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/DealerDetailModal.tsx`

### 5. ‚úÖ Search Function Enhancement
**Problem**: Search didn't include MVP Dealer booth content, limiting discoverability.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced database RPC function `search_shows_advanced` to search:
  - Show titles, descriptions, locations (existing)
  - MVP Dealer booth specialties (NEW)
  - MVP Dealer profile specialties array (NEW)
- **Database Changes**: Enhanced search RPC function with dealer content indexing

### 6. ‚úÖ My Collection Text Input Cursor Issue
**Problem**: Cursor jumped to beginning after each character typed in dealer inventory text area.
**Solution**:
- Removed problematic `key` prop causing component remounting
- Added proper TextInput properties (textAlignVertical, scrollEnabled, etc.)
- **Files Modified**: `src/screens/Collection/CollectionScreen.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details

### React Native Component Changes
- **EmailVerificationBanner.tsx** - New component for unverified user reminders
- **DealerDetailModal.tsx** - Enhanced with ScrollView and improved layout
- **CollectionScreen.tsx** - Fixed TextInput focus/cursor issues
- **supabaseAuthService.ts** - Fixed password reset URL scheme

### Database Changes
Two enhanced PostgreSQL RPC functions:

2. **search_shows_advanced** - Now searches dealer booth content and specialties
