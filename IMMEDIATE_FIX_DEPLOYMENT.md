# üöë Immediate Deployment Guide  
_fix ‚Äúinfinite recursion detected in policy for relation ‚Äòshow_participants‚Äô‚Äù_

---

## 1  Prerequisites
1. Supabase project admin access (SQL Editor).  
2. Service-role key or SQL console access.  
3. Branch `fix-show-creation-coordinates` pulled locally (contains `fix-rls-infinite-recursion.sql`).

---

## 2  Apply the RLS hot-fix (2 min)

### a. Open Supabase ‚Üí SQL Editor  
1. Create a new query tab.  
2. Paste the contents of **`fix-rls-infinite-recursion.sql`** (found at project root).  
3. Click **Run**.

The script:
‚Ä¢ Drops the recursive policies.  
‚Ä¢ Adds simplified, non-recursive policies allowing self-access plus wide read for MVP Dealers & Organizers (temporary).  

_Expected result_: ‚ÄúCOMMIT‚Äù with no errors.

---

## 3  Restart client caches (30 sec)

1. In Expo dev, press `r` to reload.  
2. For production builds:  
   ‚Ä¢ Kill & relaunch the app or publish an OTA update after merging branch (next step).

---

## 4  Deploy code update (optional but recommended)

```
git checkout main
git merge fix-show-creation-coordinates
# build / publish
eas build --profile production
```

This contains UI error-handling and the VirtualizedList fix, but the database patch alone unblocks usage.

---

## 5  Smoke-test (3 min)

1. Sign in as **MVP Dealer**.  
2. Navigate ‚Üí **My Collection**.  
   ‚Ä¢ No ‚Äúinfinite recursion‚Äù errors should appear.  
   ‚Ä¢ Attendee Want Lists load or show friendly ‚Äúsetting up‚Äù message if data missing.  
3. Sign in as **Attendee**.  
   ‚Ä¢ Create / view Want List; no errors.  
4. Run simple SQL to confirm:

```sql
select * from show_participants limit 5;
```
It should return rows without error.

---

## 6  Next Steps

The new policies are intentionally broad.  
Once stable, tighten access:

* Limit MVP Dealer visibility to shows they participate in.  
* Re-enable refined joins using `show_participants` only after adding **SECURITY INVOKER** helper views to avoid self-reference.
