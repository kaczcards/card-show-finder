# Phase 3: Dashboard Components - Complete âœ…

## Summary
Phase 3 has been successfully implemented. The admin dashboard now has full functionality for reviewing and managing pending shows from the scraper system.

## What Was Built

### 1. Approval Queue (`/admin/dashboard`)

#### âœ… Features Implemented:
- **Smart Ordering**: Shows are now sorted by `confidence_score` (descending), with highest-confidence shows appearing first
- **Interactive Show List**: Clean, responsive list view with key information at a glance
- **Confidence Badges**: Color-coded badges (green â‰¥80%, yellow â‰¥60%, red <60%)
- **Review Modal**: Full-featured modal with:
  - All show fields editable (title, location, dates, description, organizer info)
  - Pre-filled with scraped data
  - Form validation
  - "Approve with Changes" button
  - "Reject & Delete" button
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- **Quick Reject**: One-click rejection directly from the list
- **Real-time Updates**: Page refreshes automatically after approve/reject actions
- **Empty State**: Helpful UI when no pending shows exist

#### ðŸ”§ Technical Components:
- `ShowsList.tsx` - Client component for interactive list
- `ReviewModal.tsx` - Modal form for reviewing/editing shows
- `/api/shows/approve/route.ts` - API endpoint for approving shows
- `/api/shows/reject/route.ts` - API endpoint for rejecting shows

### 2. Job Logs Viewer (`/admin/logs`)

#### âœ… Features Implemented:
- **Recent Activity**: Displays the 20 most recent scraper job runs
- **Activity View**: Fetches from `v_scraper_activity` database view
- **Color-Coded Status**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **SUCCESS** - Green badge
  - ðŸ”´ **FAILED** - Red badge
  - ðŸ”µ **RUNNING** - Blue badge
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Other** - Yellow badge
- **Key Metrics Display**:
  - Job Name
  - Status
  - Start Time
  - Duration (seconds)
  - Shows Inserted/Scraped
  - Success Rate %
- **Summary Stats**: Quick overview cards showing:
  - Total jobs
  - Successful jobs
  - Failed jobs
  - Total shows inserted
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh with loading state and animation

#### ðŸ”§ Technical Components:
- `RefreshButton.tsx` - Client component for page refresh
- Enhanced logs page with better data presentation

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/shows/approve`
**Purpose**: Approve a show with admin corrections and set status to ACTIVE

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Updated Title",
  "location": "Updated Location",
  ... (all other show fields)
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "show": { ... },
  "message": "Show approved successfully"
}
```

**Security**: 
- Checks for authenticated session
- Verifies admin role from user_profiles
- Returns 401 if not authenticated, 403 if not admin

**Backend Integration**:
- Updates show record with corrected data
- Sets `status` to 'ACTIVE'
- Triggers AI learning loop (existing backend Edge Function logs corrections)

### POST `/api/shows/reject`
**Purpose**: Reject and delete a pending show

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Show rejected and deleted"
}
```

**Security**: Same authentication checks as approve endpoint

## How It Works

### Approval Workflow:
1. Admin visits `/admin/dashboard`
2. Pending shows are fetched, ordered by confidence score
3. Admin clicks "Review" on a show
4. Modal opens with pre-filled, editable form
5. Admin can:
   - Edit any field to correct scraper mistakes
   - Click "Approve with Changes" to save and activate
   - Click "Reject & Delete" to remove the show
   - Click "Cancel" or close to abort
6. On approval:
   - Show is updated in database
   - Status changes from PENDING â†’ ACTIVE
   - Backend learning loop logs corrections (existing functionality)
   - Dashboard refreshes to show updated list
7. On rejection:
   - Show is deleted from database
   - Dashboard refreshes

### Quick Reject:
- "Quick Reject" button on each show row
- Prompts for confirmation
- Deletes show without opening modal
- Refreshes dashboard

### Logs Monitoring:
1. Admin visits `/admin/logs`
2. 20 most recent jobs are displayed
3. Color-coded status badges make it easy to spot issues
4. Click "Refresh" to manually update the data
5. View detailed metrics for each job run

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

Potential enhancements for Phase 4+:
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple shows and approve/reject at once
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter by confidence level, date, location
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live dashboard updates
- **Export Functionality**: Download logs as CSV/JSON
- **Notification Center**: View and manage system notifications
- **Manual Scraper Trigger**: UI to manually trigger scraper jobs
- **Learning Loop Dashboard**: View AI learning rules and feedback
- **Show History**: Track changes made to each show

## Environment Setup

Before running the application, ensure you have:

1. **Supabase Credentials** in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://zmfqzegykwyrrvrpwylf.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd card-show-admin
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
   - Sign in with admin credentials
   - You'll be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
