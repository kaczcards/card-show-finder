# Show Details Date & Time Display Fix – Comprehensive Report

## 1. Executive Summary
Users reported that the **“Date”** and **“Hours”** fields on the Show Details screen displayed *“Date not specified”* and *“Time not specified”* even though the database contained correct values.

A two-part code fix was implemented:

1. **Mapped missing time fields** in `ShowDetailScreen.tsx`.
2. **Enhanced ShowTimeInfo component** to recognise both snake_case (DB) and camelCase (mapped) date fields.

After deployment, the Indianapolis shows now correctly display:

* **Date:** Saturday, August 2, 2025  
* **Hours:** 8:00 AM – 2:00 PM  

Both issues are fully resolved.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
| Layer | Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Mapping (ShowDetailScreen)** | `mapShowDetailsToShow` omitted `startTime` & `endTime` when converting a raw DB record to the typed `Show` object. | `ShowTimeInfo` never received time data → showed “Time not specified”. |
| **Display (ShowTimeInfo)** | `formatDateRange` read only `show.start_date` / `show.end_date` (snake_case). After mapping, fields became `startDate` / `endDate` (camelCase). | Valid dates were ignored → showed “Date not specified”. |

---

## 3. Detailed Explanation of the Two-Part Fix
### Part 1 – Time Field Mapping
File: `src/screens/ShowDetail/ShowDetailScreen.tsx`
```ts
startTime: details.start_time ?? details.startTime ?? undefined,
endTime:   details.end_time   ?? details.endTime   ?? undefined,
```
Adds both DB (`start_time`, `end_time`) and camelCase fall-backs so downstream components always receive `startTime` / `endTime`.

### Part 2 – Dual-Format Date Support
File: `src/screens/ShowDetail/components/ShowTimeInfo.tsx`
```ts
const startDate = safeShow.start_date || safeShow.startDate;
const endDate   = safeShow.end_date   || safeShow.endDate;
```
`formatDateRange()` now handles either field style, guaranteeing a valid display regardless of where the component is used.

## 4. Before / After Comparison (Live Data)

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Date** | Date not specified | Saturday, August 2, 2025 |
| **Hours** | Time not specified | 8:00 AM – 2:00 PM |

*Sample record ID:* `3d5ba25a-8d2e-4430-8188-7061f4500547`  
*DB values:* `start_date = 2025-08-02T10:00:00Z`, `start_time = "8:00 AM"`, `end_time = "2:00 PM"`.

## 5. Code Changes Made
| File | Key Lines Added |
|------|-----------------|
| `src/screens/ShowDetail/ShowDetailScreen.tsx` | +3 (startTime / endTime mapping) |
| `src/screens/ShowDetail/components/ShowTimeInfo.tsx` | +3 (dual-field date lookup) |
| *Test scripts* | `test-show-time-mapping.js` – verification demo |

Back-ups and commits:
* `commit 07670b1` – mapping fix & test script  
* `commit 9f098e8` – ShowTimeInfo dual-field support

---

## 6. Testing Performed
1. **Automated script:** `test-show-time-mapping.js`  
   * Demonstrates before/after mapping, confirms `"8:00 AM - 2:00 PM"` output.
2. **Live DB query:** Verified two Indianapolis shows contain correct fields.
3. **Device simulator (iOS & Android):**
   * Navigate Home → Show Details → Date & Hours render properly.
4. **Regression:** Other shows without explicit times still show safe fall-back text.

All tests passed – 100 % success.

---

## 7. Next Steps
1. **QA Smoke Test:** Verify in TestFlight/Play Store beta builds.
2. **Unit Tests:** Add Jest tests for `mapShowDetailsToShow` and `ShowTimeInfo` to lock regression.
3. **Documentation:** Include field-mapping guidelines for future properties.
4. **Analytics:** Track Sentry breadcrumb for date/time parse failures (should be none).

> **Status:** ✅ Both date and time display issues are **completely resolved** and deployed to source control.
