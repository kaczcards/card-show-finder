## Problem
When an MVP Dealer registers for a show, the registration succeeds, but the dealer is **not shown with the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù indicator** in the ‚ÄúParticipating Dealers‚Äù section of the Show Detail screen.  
This prevents users from identifying premium vendors and blocks planned MVP-only actions (dealer profile modal, direct messaging).

### Root Cause
`fetchParticipatingDealers` filtered profiles with an OR clause using **uppercase** role values:

```ts
.or('role.eq.MVP_DEALER,role.eq.DEALER')
```

The `profiles.role` column stores lowercase strings (`mvp_dealer`, `dealer`).  
Because of this case mismatch the Supabase filter returned zero rows ‚Üí UI never received MVP dealers.

---

## Solution
* **Query updated** to match DB convention:

```diff
- .or('role.eq.MVP_DEALER,role.eq.DEALER');
+ .or('role.eq.mvp_dealer,role.eq.dealer'); // roles are stored lowercase
```

* Added inline comment to prevent regressions.

_No schema or service-layer change required._

## How to Test
1. Log in with a user whose `profiles.role = 'mvp_dealer'`.  
2. Register for any upcoming show.  
3. Open **Show Details** for that show.  
4. Verify:  
   - Dealer appears as **`Name (MVP)`** in the list.  
   - Name is blue & tappable ‚Üí opens dealer detail modal.  
   - ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù button is present.  
5. Repeat with a regular `dealer` role ‚Üí should list without ‚Äú(MVP)‚Äù tag and without message button.  

---

## Deployment Notes
No migrations, env vars, or build-time changes.  
Ensure existing role strings in **profiles** remain lowercase (`dealer`, `mvp_dealer`, etc.).
