# PR: Fix Spatial Query Errors & Add Client-Side ZIP Code Caching

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs New
| Area | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `src/services/showService.ts` | **Fix** | Replaced brittle `st_dwithin` filter with a call to a dedicated **RPC** (`find_shows_within_radius`) eliminating `PGRST100` syntax errors. |
| `src/services/locationService.ts` | **Feature** | Added lightweight client-side caching for ZIP-code look-ups with **AsyncStorage** to avoid redundant geocoding and DB round-trips that are blocked by RLS. |
| `src/services/locationService.ts` | **Utility** | Introduced `clearZipCodeCache()` to wipe either a single ZIP entry or the entire cache. |
| `db_functions.sql` | **Feature** | New SQL script that creates the `find_shows_within_radius` function (and placeholder for richer `find_filtered_shows`). This powers the RPC used by the app. |

## 1  Spatial Query Syntax Fix (showService.ts)

### Before  
```ts
query.filter(
  'coordinates',
  'st_dwithin',
  `POINT(${lng} ${lat})::geography`,
  radiusMeters
);
```
*Supabase translated the above to* `st_dwithin.POINT(...` *which Postgres rejected.*

### After ‚Äî now using an RPC  
```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('find_shows_within_radius', {
  center_lat: lat,
  center_lng: lng,
  radius_miles: radius
});
```
Key changes  
1. All heavy geospatial work is handled **inside Postgres** via a reusable SQL function.  
2. The client no longer needs to build fragile PostgREST filter strings.  
3. Easier to extend in the future (`find_filtered_shows` already scaffolded).  

Result: `getShows()` now returns data instead of throwing `failed to parse filter‚Ä¶`.

## 2  Client-Side ZIP Code Caching (locationService.ts)

### Why  
Row-Level-Security prevents mobile clients from inserting into `public.zip_codes`, so every sign-in forced a live geocode. We now persist look-ups locally.

### How  

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Key Prefix | `@zip_cache:<ZIP>` ensures isolation in AsyncStorage. |
| Look-up | `getZipCodeCoordinates()` checks cache first ‚Üí DB ‚Üí geocode service. |
| Cache Write | Newly geocoded results saved with `setZipCache()`. |
| RLS Note | We **still** skip DB inserts to respect existing security policy. |

### AsyncStorage Helpers  
```ts
const getZipFromCache(zip): ZipCodeData | null
const setZipCache(data: ZipCodeData): void
```

## 3  Cache Maintenance Utility

```ts
clearZipCodeCache(zip?: string): Promise<void>
```
* When a `zip` is supplied only that entry is removed.  
* With no argument all cached ZIP entries are purged (filtered by prefix).

## üß™ Testing

1. **Spatial Search**
   1. Launch app ‚Äì Home screen should load without `PGRST100`.
   2. Change radius / location; verify results update.
2. **ZIP Code Cache**
   1. Fresh install ‚Üí register with ZIP **46060**.  
   2. Observe console:  
      - First run: *‚Äúgeocoded on-device ‚Äì not cached in DB due to RLS.‚Äù*  
      - Subsequent launches: data retrieved from AsyncStorage, no geocoding call.
   3. Run `clearZipCodeCache()` in dev menu, restart ‚Üí geocode fires again.

## üîÑ Migration / Config

Run `db_functions.sql` (or copy the statements into Supabase SQL editor) to create the new function(s).  
Ensure `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` is installed (already in `package.json`).
