## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. Code Changes ✅ **PUSHED TO GITHUB**
All authentication fixes have been committed and pushed to the repository:

- ✅ `src/services/supabaseAuthService.ts` - Email redirect URLs fixed, duplicate profile creation removed

## 🚀 Next Step: Build Production App

Now that everything is pushed to GitHub, build the production app:

### Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/card-show-finder

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Or build both at once
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

### Option 2: Expo Publish (Over-the-Air JS Update)

**Note:** This only works for JavaScript changes. Since we stubbed the IAP service (native code), you may need a full EAS build.

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/card-show-finder

# Publish OTA update
npx expo publish --release-channel production
```

## 📋 What Got Fixed

### Issues Resolved:
1. ✅ **Infinite recursion in RLS policies** - Login now works
2. ✅ **Registration profile creation** - Profiles created automatically
3. ✅ **Email verification** - Required before app access
4. ✅ **Password reset** - Emails sent with correct web link
5. ✅ **Missing profiles handling** - Better error messages

### User Experience Improvements:
- 🚀 Smoother registration process

## 🔄 After Successful Production Testing

Once you confirm everything works in production:

### Restore IAP Service:

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/card-show-finder/src/services

# Restore original IAP service
rm appleIAPService.ts
mv appleIAPService.ts.backup appleIAPService.ts

# Reinstall native dependency
npm install react-native-iap

# Rebuild app
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Build for production
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

### Clean Up Test Files:

```bash
# These files were for testing/deployment only
rm fix-rls-recursion-APPLY-NOW.sql
rm COMPREHENSIVE-RLS-FIX.sql
rm FIX-NOW-IDEMPOTENT.sql
rm VERIFY-AND-FIX.sql
rm fix-missing-profile.sql
rm COPY-THIS-TO-SUPABASE.txt

# Commit cleanup
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: clean up deployment test files"
git push origin main
