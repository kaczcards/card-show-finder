# PR: In-App Messaging System Implementation

## Overview

This PR implements a complete messaging system for Card Show Finder, allowing users to communicate with each other directly within the app. The implementation includes:

- Database structure for storing and retrieving messages
- Direct messaging UI with conversation list and message detail views
- Support for read receipts and unread message counts
- Role-based permissions (ATTENDEE can message anyone, only MVP_DEALER and SHOW_ORGANIZER can respond)

## Changes

### 1. Database Schema
- Created a `messages` table with fields for conversation tracking, content, and read status
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data protection
- Added a `get_user_conversations` function for efficient conversation retrieval

### 2. New Components
- Added `src/screens/Messages/DirectMessagesScreen.tsx` for the main messaging UI
- Implemented conversation list and message detail views in a single component
- Created a debug panel for monitoring messaging operations

### 3. Navigation
- Updated `MainTabNavigator.tsx` to include a Messages tab with appropriate icons

## Technical Details

### Authentication Approach
The messaging system connects directly to Supabase authentication instead of using the app's AuthContext. This ensures reliable operation even if there are syncing issues between the AuthContext and the Supabase session.

### Real-time Updates
The implementation uses Supabase's real-time subscription capabilities to update conversations and messages immediately when new messages arrive.

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes on key fields (conversation_id, sender_id, recipient_id) for efficient queries
- Optimized data fetching to minimize the number of database calls
- Conversation grouping to organize messages efficiently

## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Run the `db_migrations/simple_messages_schema.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor

2. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Navigate to the Messages tab
   - Send a test message to yourself using the form
   - Verify the message appears in your conversations list
   - Open the conversation and check that the message appears correctly

3. **Role-Based Testing**:
   - Log in as a regular ATTENDEE and try sending messages
   - Log in as an MVP_DEALER and verify you can respond to messages
   - Verify DEALER users without MVP status cannot respond

## Known Limitations

- The UI is functional but may need design refinements
- There's no direct way to start a conversation with a specific user from other screens yet
- User selection is currently limited to entering user IDs manually

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with user profiles for easier recipient selection
2. Message attachments (images, files)
3. Push notifications for new messages
4. Message search functionality
5. Ability to delete or archive conversations

This PR is part of the core messaging feature set and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
