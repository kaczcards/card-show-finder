# Map Functionality – Fix Validation Checklist

This document records the problems found in the map screen, the code changes applied, and the steps required to verify that every user (anonymous or authenticated) can now see card shows happening **within 25 miles of their location (or home ZIP) and starting in the next 30 days**.

## 1 · Issues Identified

| # | Problem | Impact |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | `MapShowCluster` rendered before data finished loading and therefore received an **empty `shows` array (0 shows)** on first paint. | Users briefly saw an empty map or “No shows” state, causing confusion. |
| 2 | Prop name mismatch – `MapScreen` passed `onShowPress` while `MapShowCluster` expected `onCalloutPress`. | Call-outs were non-responsive on some devices. |
| 3 | Loading / empty / error states were all driven solely by `loading` & `shows.length`, missing the moment when the first fetch completed. | Spurious empty-state & error banners. |
| 4 | Debugging visibility: difficult to confirm when the first non-empty result reached the cluster component. | Slowed troubleshooting. |

## 2 · Changes Implemented

1. **Timing Guard**
   • Added `dataLoaded` flag in `MapScreen` to mark the completion of at least one fetch cycle.  
   • UI now waits for `dataLoaded === true` before rendering empty or error states.

2. **Atomic State Update Order**
   • `shows` state is now set **before** `loading` is cleared and **dataLoaded** is toggled, ensuring the cluster never receives an empty array after the fetch resolves.

3. **Prop Alignment**
   • Renamed prop in `MapScreen` → `MapShowCluster` call to `onCalloutPress`, matching the component API.

4. **Instrumentation**
   • Added render-timestamp & show-count logs in `MapShowCluster` to confirm:
     - First render with 0 shows (expected)
     - Subsequent render with ≥1 shows
     - Detection of first non-empty payload

5. **Production-ready Data Path**
   • `MapScreen` continues to call `getPaginatedShows`, which internally uses the **direct-query fallback** (bypassing the broken `nearby_shows` RPC).  
   • Radius, date-range, pagination, and coordinate extraction all occur server-side or in the robust client helper.

## 3 · Validation Steps

Follow these steps on **dev**, **staging**, and **production** builds.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Fresh install / clear cache → Launch app as **anonymous** user. | Loading spinner, then map with show pins (if any) within 25 mi of device GPS. No immediate “No shows” splash. |
| 2 | Sign in as **user with ONLY GPS (no home ZIP)**. | Same success criteria as Step 1. |
| 3 | Disable location permissions, ensure profile has **home ZIP only**. | Toast indicates ZIP fallback; map centers on ZIP; shows within 25 mi of ZIP render. |
| 4 | User with **both GPS and ZIP** → grant location. | GPS wins; map centers on GPS; correct pins show. |
| 5 | Pull-to-refresh. | Spinner shown, then pins refresh; cluster never flashes empty. |
| 6 | Tap any marker → callout “View Details”. | Navigates to Show Detail screen. |
| 7 | Kill & relaunch app. | No “0 show” flash; immediately shows spinner then populated map. |
| 8 | Inspect console logs. | Line `[MapShowCluster] First non-empty shows array received…` appears once per load cycle, confirming timing fix. |

## 4 · Expected Behaviour (All User Types)

• First screen paint shows **spinner** – never empty state.  
• After fetch completes (`≤2 s on Wi-Fi`), pins/ clusters appear.  
• Map always contains every ACTIVE show:
  - Start date ≥ today and ≤ today + 30 days  
  - End date ≥ today  
  - Distance ≤ 25 miles from user’s determined coordinates  
• Callouts open, link to details, and external map links function.

## 5 · Production-ready Confirmation

- Source of truth: `getPaginatedShows()` → `getDirectPaginatedShows()`  
  (Supabase direct query with coordinate fallback)  
- No reliance on deprecated or flaky RPCs.  
- Defensive coordinate sanitisation prevents map crashes.  
- Added diagnostics remain behind `__DEV__` guards; production builds are unaffected in performance.
