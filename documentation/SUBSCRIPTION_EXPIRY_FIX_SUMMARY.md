# Subscription Expiry Fix – Summary  
_File: **SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRY_FIX_SUMMARY.md**_

---

## 1 · Original Problem

When a user upgraded from the free-trial to a paid plan:

* The subscription continued to show “Free Trial” status.  
* The system set the **same expiry date as the 7-day trial** instead of the paid term.  
* Annual plans expired after 7 days (trial length) instead of **365 days**.  
* Monthly plans expired after 7 days instead of **30 days**.

Result: paid users lost access almost immediately and had to contact support.

---

## 2 · Root Cause

1. **Faulty helper**  
   `calculateExpiryDate()` added `trialDays` **instead of** the paid period.  
2. **Upgrade workflow reused trial logic**  
   `processSubscriptionUpdate()` re-applied the helper with the bug and **did not terminate** the free trial on upgrade.  
3. **Month vs. Year math**  
   The previous code used JavaScript’s `setMonth()` which creates variable-length months (28–31 days) and leap-year edge cases.

## 3 · Fix Implemented

| Layer | Change |
|-------|--------|
| `src/services/subscriptionTypes.ts` | • Re-wrote `calculateExpiryDate()`<br>   – **Annual:** `+365` days<br>   – **Monthly:** `+30` days<br>• Removed all trial handling from the helper (trials handled elsewhere). |
| `src/services/stripePaymentService.ts` | • `processSubscriptionUpdate()` now calls the corrected helper and **ignores `trialDays`** when a user pays.<br>• Paid period starts immediately, ending any trial. |
| Tests | `test-subscription-fix.js` verifies:<br>   – Annual plans → **365 days**<br>   – Monthly plans → **30 days**<br>   – Trial days no longer influence expiry. |

## 4 · Testing Results

```
🔍 Testing Subscription Expiry Date Calculation
✅ mvp-dealer-monthly: 30 days (expected 30)
✅ mvp-dealer-annual:  365 days (expected 365)
✅ show-organizer-monthly: 30 days
✅ show-organizer-annual:  365 days

Old vs New behaviour (annual plan with 7-day trial):
• Old: 7 days  ❌
• New: 365 days ✅
```

All four plan types now pass, confirming correct expiry logic.

## 5 · Impact on Users

* **Free-trial ends on upgrade** – users instantly become paying subscribers.  
* **Accurate access window** – Annual = 365 days, Monthly = 30 days.  
* **Fewer support tickets** – no premature expirations.  
* **Billing clarity** – dashboard reflects the true “Next billing date”.

_The fix is live; no action is required from existing subscribers—their expiry dates were recalculated during deployment._
