# PR: Enhanced Messaging System Implementation

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive messaging system for Card Show Finder, following the product droid's architecture recommendations. The implementation includes:

- Advanced database structure for supporting direct, group, and show-specific conversations
- Flexible UI that adapts to different conversation types
- Support for read receipts with multiple users per conversation
- Role-based permissions (ATTENDEE can message anyone, only MVP_DEALER and SHOW_ORGANIZER can respond)

## Major Components

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema
- **Conversations Table**: Tracks conversation metadata with type (direct/group/show), show association, and last message details
- **Conversation_Participants Table**: Junction table for many-to-many relationships between users and conversations
- **Messages Table**: Enhanced with read_by_user_ids array (vs. single read_at timestamp)
- **SQL Functions**: Helper functions for common operations (mark as read, create conversation, etc.)

### 2. Messaging Service
- Complete TypeScript service with strongly-typed interfaces
- Comprehensive functions for all messaging operations
- Support for real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

### 3. UI Components
- Conversation list with support for both direct and group chats
- Message detail view with read indicators
- New conversation creation interface

## Technical Details

### Schema Migrations
The implementation includes a migration script that:
1. Creates new tables while preserving existing data
2. Sets up proper relationships and indexes 
3. Creates helper functions for common operations
4. Establishes RLS policies for security

### Real-time Updates
The implementation uses Supabase's real-time subscription capabilities to update conversations and messages immediately when new messages arrive.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Run the `db_migrations/enhanced_messaging_schema.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor

2. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Navigate to the Messages tab
   - Create a new conversation by pressing the + button
   - Send messages and verify real-time updates

3. **Test Mode**:
   The messaging screen includes a "TEST MODE" banner indicating that role-based restrictions are bypassed for testing.

## Future Work

1. **User Search**: Add ability to search for users by name/username instead of UUIDs
2. **Show Integration**: Connect conversations directly to show pages
3. **Rich Media**: Support for images and attachments
4. **Push Notifications**: Add push notification support for new messages
