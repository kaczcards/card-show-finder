# Favorites Authentication Fix – Detailed Technical Summary

## 🐞 Problem Statement  
Users (all roles) received the alert  

```
Sign In Required
Please sign in to save favorites
```  

whenever they tapped the **Save** (♥) button on a show, even though they were already authenticated.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. AuthContext API shape  
`useAuth()` returns the *entire* context object:

```ts
type AuthContextType = {
  authState: { user: User | null; ... };
  addFavoriteShow: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
  /* …other helpers… */
}
```

`user` therefore lives under **`authState.user`**.

### 2. ShowDetailScreen misuse  
`ShowDetailScreen.tsx` tried to destructure `user` directly:

```ts
// ❌ old code
const { user, userProfile } = useAuth();   // user === undefined
```

Because `user` was `undefined`, the guard inside `toggleFavorite`
always triggered:

```ts
if (!user) {
  Alert.alert('Sign In Required', ...);
  return;
}
```

### 3. Result  
Regardless of the real session stored in Supabase/AsyncStorage,
favorites logic aborted, producing the false-positive auth error.

## ✅ The Fix

### 1. Correctly access the user

```ts
// ✔ new code
const { authState } = useAuth();
const { user } = authState;
```

### 2. Update role logic & effects  
All checks that previously relied on `userProfile` now use
`user.role` (the role is already part of the User model).

```ts
const userRole = user.role as UserRole;
setIsShowOrganizer(userRole === UserRole.SHOW_ORGANIZER);
```

### 3. Effect dependency tweaks  
`useEffect` hooks watching `{ user, userProfile }` were collapsed to
watch only `{ user }`, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

## 🧪 Verification

| Scenario | Expected | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Attendee favorites an upcoming show | Show saved, heart icon filled | ✅ |
| Dealer / MVP Dealer / Organizer | Same as above | ✅ |
| Unauthenticated user | Receives “Sign In Required” alert | ✅ (intended) |
| App restart then favorite toggle | State persists & toggles | ✅ |

Manual tests were executed on iOS Simulator & Android Emulator with
Supabase sessions restored from storage.

## 🗂️ Files Touched

| File | Key Change |
|------|------------|
| `src/screens/ShowDetail/ShowDetailScreen.tsx` | Correct `useAuth` usage, role checks, effect deps |

No changes to backend tables or Supabase policies were required.

## 🚀 Impact

* Restores core **Save/Favorite** feature across all authenticated roles.  
* Eliminates misleading authentication prompts, improving UX.  
* Aligns component usage with the official AuthContext contract, reducing future bugs.
