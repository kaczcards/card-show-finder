# Implementation Summary – Show Creation Coordinate Fix

## 1. What Was Fixed
* **Crash on show creation**  
  When a Show Organizer tapped “Create Show” the app threw  
  `TypeError: undefined is not a function` and the show was never saved.

* **Root cause**  
  `supabase.sql\`` was called inside `src/screens/Organizer/AddShowScreen.tsx` to
  build a PostGIS `POINT`.  
  The tag ✨does not exist✨ in **@supabase/supabase-js v2.x**, so the call
  exploded before the insert reached Supabase.

---

## 2. How It Was Fixed
| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **Coordinate handling** | Replaced the invalid template tag with a **WKT string**: `POINT(<longitude> <latitude>)`. Postgres automatically casts WKT text to `geography(point)`. |
| **Screen logic** | Updated `AddShowScreen.tsx` to compose the WKT, insert it, and keep snake_case keys that match the DB. |
| **Geocoding helper** | Added a lightweight inline `geocodeAddress()` using Nominatim (removes brittle import). |
| **Validation & UX** | Retained existing smart address validation, added RLS-aware error messages, and mapped common PG error codes (23502, 23505, 42883) to friendly alerts. |
| **Docs** | Committed `PR_DESCRIPTION_SHOW_CREATION_FIX.md` for reviewers. |

Branch: **`fix-show-creation-coordinates`**  
Commit: `a7cd905` (code) + `8dd525b` (docs)

## 3. Why This Solution Was Chosen
1. **Standards-compliant:** WKT is a first-class text format understood by PostGIS; no custom SQL required.
2. **Library-agnostic:** Avoids private Supabase APIs so future library updates remain safe.
3. **Minimal blast radius:** Only one screen touched; database schema unchanged.
4. **Transparent for DB:** Postgres casts the string, allowing existing GIST index & spatial queries to keep working.

## 4. Next Steps (Creating the PR)
1. Ensure local branch is pushed:  
   `git push -u origin fix-show-creation-coordinates`
2. On GitHub create a Pull Request into **main** using the prepared description file:
   `PR_DESCRIPTION_SHOW_CREATION_FIX.md`
3. Request reviewers from:
   * @kaczcards
   * mobile team lead
4. After approval **squash-merge** with “Fix: Replace supabase.sql with WKT format”.

## 5. How to Test the Fix

### Manual Happy Path
1. **Login** as a user with `SHOW_ORGANIZER` role.
2. Navigate to **Organizer → Add Show**.
3. Fill out a valid address (e.g.  
   `17000 Mercantile Blvd, Noblesville, IN 46060`) and submit.
4. Success toast appears, app navigates back, and the new show appears on:
   * Organizer dashboard list
   * Map screen (pin at the correct location)

### Validation / Error Paths
| Scenario | Expected Behaviour |
|----------|-------------------|
| Missing address parts | Inline validation blocks submission. |
| Invalid ZIP / state | Specific helper message shown. |
| Geocoding returns (0,0) | Warn user and allow cancel. |
| Duplicate title | PG error 23505 converted to “Show may already exist”. |

### Database Check
```sql
SELECT id, ST_AsText(coordinates)
FROM   public.shows
WHERE  title = 'Your New Show';
```
Output should contain `POINT(<lng> <lat>)` matching your entry.

If all tests pass, the fix is verified ✅
