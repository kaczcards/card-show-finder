# FINAL_STATUS_WANT_LISTS_FIX.md  
Attendee Want-Lists – Final Status Summary
=========================================

## 1. Key Discoveries During Debugging
1. **Wrong table referenced** – service code queried `planned_attendance`, while UI writes to `user_favorite_shows`.
2. **Row-Level-Security (RLS) blockade** – `user_favorite_shows` allowed `SELECT` only where `auth.uid() = user_id`; MVP dealers/organizers could not read attendee rows.
3. **Writes silently failing** – mobile app attempted `INSERT` operations while *not authenticated*, so nothing was persisted and the UI only showed local state.

---

## 2. Complete Solution Created
| Layer | Fix Implemented | File / Location |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Service code | Query updated to use `user_favorite_shows`; added date & role filtering. | `src/services/showWantListService.ts` |
| Database | New RLS policies grant **read-only** access:<br>• MVP Dealers → favorites of shows they participate in<br>• Show Organizers → favorites of shows they organize | `fix-user-favorite-shows-rls.sql` |
| Documentation | Step-by-step SQL instructions, auth guidance, testing plan, deployment checklist | `RLS_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `COMPLETE_WANT_LISTS_FIX.md` |

---

## 3. What Still Needs to Be Done
1. **Run the SQL script** `fix-user-favorite-shows-rls.sql` in Supabase to create the new policies.  
2. **Ship mobile-app auth update**: ensure every DB write happens through an *authenticated* Supabase client session.  
3. **Seed real data**: heart a show & create want-list as attendee, register dealer for same show, then refresh dealer screen.  
4. **Smoke-test** all paths (dealer, organizer, attendee) using the Testing Plan.

---

## 4. Expected Outcome After Implementation
• Attendees can persist ♥ favourites and want-lists.  
• MVP dealers & show organizers immediately see attendee want-lists for upcoming shows they share.  
• Security preserved – no broad table access, attendees still control their own data.  
• Feature functions end-to-end across web & mobile.

## 5. Action Items Checklist
| # | Owner | Action | Status |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | DBA | Run `fix-user-favorite-shows-rls.sql` in production Supabase | ☐ |
| 2 | Mobile Dev | Add / verify user authentication flow (sign-in, session restore) | ☐ |
| 3 | Mobile Dev | Replace unauthenticated Supabase client calls with authed client | ☐ |
| 4 | QA | Follow **Testing Plan** in `COMPLETE_WANT_LISTS_FIX.md` | ☐ |
| 5 | PM | Confirm dealers/organizers see want-lists in staging, then prod | ☐ |

Once all boxes are checked, the want-lists feature is **officially fixed and ready for release**.
