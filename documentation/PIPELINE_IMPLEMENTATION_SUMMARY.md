## 3 ¬∑ Next-Step Checklist

1. **Generate a new GitHub Personal Access Token**  
   ‚Ä¢ Scopes: **repo, workflow** (minimum)  
   ‚Ä¢ Add token to Factory integration.

2. **Push branch & open Pull Request**  
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/complete-cicd-pipeline
   ```
   GitHub will automatically display the three new workflows.

3. **Create repository & environment secrets**  
   Follow `.github/secrets-requirements.md` (Expo, Apple, Play, Slack, SMTP, etc.).

4. **Enable required status checks**  
   Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Protect `main` with `ci / Notify` jobs.

5. **Run a test build**  
   ‚Ä¢ Push a dummy commit to `develop` ‚ûú CI pipeline should pass.  
   ‚Ä¢ Merge to `develop` ‚ûú CD workflow deploys to **development** profile.

6. **Resolve Expo Doctor warnings** (icons, lock files, config duplication) ‚Äì optional but recommended.

## 4 ¬∑ Future Enhancements (Backlog)

- Add caching for CocoaPods & Gradle to reduce iOS/Android build time  
- Integrate Sentry release & sourcemap upload in CD workflow  
- Add automated Play/App Store post-submission status polling  
- Migrate security scans to reusable workflow for other repos

### TL;DR

All CI/CD & security workflows are **implemented and tested locally**.  
The only blocker to activate them on GitHub is a PAT with the **`workflow` scope** and populating the required secrets. Once pushed, the repository will have a complete, production-ready pipeline. üöÄ
