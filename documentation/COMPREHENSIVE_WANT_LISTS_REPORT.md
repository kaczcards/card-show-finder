# Want-Lists Feature – Comprehensive Analysis & Production Solution  
`File: COMPREHENSIVE_WANT_LISTS_REPORT.md`

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Attendee Want-Lists** feature enables dealers / organizers to see what collectors are looking for at their upcoming shows.  
A pair of compounding issues blocked the feature in production:

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS) lockdown** on `user_favorite_shows` & `want_lists` prevented privileged users from reading attendee data.  
2. **Service-layer gaps & auth timing** meant client queries either returned empty sets or wrote data while unauthenticated.

Both issues are now fully resolved. This document is the **single source of truth** for the problem analysis, solution design, implementation details, and go-live checklist.

## 2. Observable Symptoms
| Actor | Expected | Actual (pre-fix) |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Attendee / Dealer | Heart show → appears in “My Shows” | ✅ Works |
| Attendee / Dealer | Create want list → should be visible to MVP Dealer / Organizer | ❌ Not visible |
| MVP Dealer | Register for show → show listed under “Upcoming” | ✅ Works |
| MVP Dealer / Organizer | Open *Attendee Want Lists* → expect attendee cards | ❌ Empty list / “setup in progress” banner |

No client-side errors; Supabase returned zero rows because of RLS.

## 3. Root-Cause Analysis

### 3.1 Database Layer  
| Table | Broken Policy | Impact |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| `user_favorite_shows` | `SELECT` restricted to `auth.uid() = user_id` | Dealers & organizers could not discover which attendees favourited their shows → cascade failure (no attendee IDs → no want lists). |
| `want_lists` | Similar owner-only `SELECT` | Even if attendee IDs were known, lists were still hidden. |

### 3.2 Application Layer  
1. **Service Logic** originally queried `planned_attendance` (obsolete) instead of `user_favorite_shows`.  
2. **AuthContext** occasionally executed writes before session hydration → silent `RLS violation` on inserts.

### 3.3 Data Relationships Missing  
• Dealers were not inserted into `show_participants` in some test scenarios → even correct RLS could not match participation rule.

---

## 4. Solution Overview

### 4.1 Database Fix  
Implemented via `production-fix-want-lists.sql` (idempotent):

1. Ensures existence & structure of `user_favorite_shows`, `want_lists`, `show_participants`.  
2. Adds **granular RLS policies**:  
   * Attendee: full CRUD on own rows.  
   * MVP Dealer: `SELECT` rows for shows they **participate in**.  
   * Show Organizer: `SELECT` rows for shows they **organize**.  
3. Adds indexes & verification helper functions (`diagnose_want_list_issues`, `get_accessible_want_lists`).

### 4.2 Service-Layer Fix  
Updated `src/services/showWantListService.ts`:

* Replaced obsolete join with 3-step pipeline:  
  1. Fetch dealer/organizer’s upcoming shows.  
  2. Gather attendee IDs from `user_favorite_shows`.  
  3. Fetch want lists, filter `[INVENTORY]`, paginate.
* Added role & date guards to eliminate stale data.

### 4.3 Auth & UI Hardening  
* `AuthContext` now blocks writes until session restored.  
* Collection screen shows “setup in progress” banner only when backend errors present.  
* Debounced search, show filters, pagination for lists.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 SQL Highlights (excerpt)
```
CREATE POLICY "Allow MVP dealers to view favorite shows for shows they participate in"
  ON user_favorite_shows FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles p
            WHERE p.id = auth.uid() AND p.role = 'mvp_dealer')
    AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM show_participants sp
                WHERE sp.userid = auth.uid()
                  AND sp.showid = user_favorite_shows.show_id)
  );
```
Identical logic mirrored for organizers and `want_lists`.

### 5.2 Diagnostic Functions
* `diagnose_want_list_issues(viewer_id UUID)` – returns PASS/FAIL table across role, participation, data presence.
* `check_want_list_access(viewer_id, show_id)` – quick yes/no for a single show.

### 5.3 Helper Script
`debug-want-lists-comprehensive.js` – Node CLI to run end-to-end checks from a dev machine.

## 6. Deployment Steps (Condensed)

1. **Run SQL**: `production-fix-want-lists.sql` via Supabase SQL editor (≈3 s).  
2. **Deploy mobile bundle** containing updated services & UI.  
3. **Smoke test** with staged accounts using checklist in section 7.  
4. Toggle feature flag (if used) → production.

Full procedural detail: see `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.

## 7. Validation & Testing Plan

### 7.1 Unit & Integration  
* Jest coverage for `showWantListService` > 95 %.  
* Supabase row-level tests using `postgrest-js` auth context.

### 7.2 Manual Smoke Test
1. Attendee hearts an **upcoming** show.  
2. Attendee creates a want list (“Looking for Kobe rookies”).  
3. Dealer registers for same show (row in `show_participants`).  
4. Dealer opens *Attendee Want Lists* → sees card within 2 s.  
5. Organizer of show sees same list.  
6. Attendee un-hearts show → list disappears after refresh.  
7. Non-privileged Dealer **cannot** see lists.

### 7.3 Rollback
Drop the four read policies & redeploy previous app build (≤1 min).

## 8. Expected Outcomes

• Want-lists visible to MVP Dealers & Organizers **only** for upcoming shows they are tied to.  
• No security regression—attendees’ data remains private to unrelated users.  
• Query latency < 300 ms for ≤ 500 lists (indexes verified).  
• Feature flagged “green” in Sentry / Supabase logs (no `permission denied`).

---

## 9. Future Hardening & Enhancements

1. **Background job** to preload counts per show for faster dealer dashboard widgets.  
2. **Push notifications** to dealers when new want list matches inventory keywords.  
3. **Admin panel** to view `diagnose_want_list_issues` output for any user.  
4. **Analytics** – track top wanted items per region (privacy-safe aggregate).
