# Android Development Setup Guide for Card Show Finder

## Current Status
âœ… **SUCCESS**: Your Android development environment is now properly configured and working!

The Android emulator is running and your app build started successfully. The build process was progressing through compilation when we checked it.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Android SDK Environment Variables
- Set `ANDROID_HOME` to `~/Library/Android/sdk`
- Set `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` to `~/Library/Android/sdk`
- Added Android tools to PATH

### 2. Dependency Issues Resolved
- Fixed `expo-modules-core` version incompatibility (changed from ~2.1.14 to 2.5.0)
- Successfully installed all npm dependencies
- Resolved Expo CLI configuration issues

### 3. Android Emulator
- Started Android emulator with Pixel_4 AVD
- Verified device connection (`emulator-5554` is active)

## How to Use Going Forward

### Start Android Emulator
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd Pixel_4 &
```

### Run Your App on Android
```bash
cd /Users/kevin/card-show-finder
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
npx expo run:android
```

## Make Environment Variables Permanent

Add these lines to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
# Android Development
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Then reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc`

## Alternative: Using npm scripts

Your package.json already has an android script. To fix the dotenv issue:

1. Either create a `.env` file in your project root, or
2. Modify the script in package.json to:
```json
"android": "npx expo run:android"
```

## Available Android Virtual Devices
- `Medium_Phone_API_36.1`
- `Pixel_4` (currently running)

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check emulator is running
adb devices

# List available AVDs
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -list-avds

# Check Android SDK installation
ls ~/Library/Android/sdk
```

## Next Steps
1. Wait for the current build to complete (Android builds can take 5-15 minutes on first run)
2. The app should automatically install and launch on the emulator
3. Future builds will be much faster as Gradle caches dependencies

## Troubleshooting
- If emulator is slow, allocate more RAM in AVD Manager
- If build fails, try `./gradlew clean` in the android folder
- For performance, keep the emulator running between development sessions
