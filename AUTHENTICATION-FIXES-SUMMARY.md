# Authentication & Registration Fixes – Summary  
_Last updated: July 7 2025_

This document aggregates **all code, configuration, and UX improvements** applied to resolve the critical authentication issues reported in “Bugs found in CSF.pdf”.

---

## 1 · Environment & Configuration

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **`.env` file introduced** (keys: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`). | Supplies Supabase & Google Maps credentials outside source control. |
| **`app.config.js`** now loads **dotenv** and validates presence of required vars, emitting console warnings if missing. | Prevents silent mis-configuration that led to *Network request failed* errors. |
| **`.gitignore`** already excludes `.env*`; confirmed no secrets are committed. | Security best-practice maintained. |

---

## 2 · Supabase Auth Service Enhancements (`src/services/supabaseAuthService.ts`)

### Connectivity & Initialization
* Added **`NetInfo`** check – registration/login abort early with a clear “No internet connection” error.
* Introduced **`isSupabaseInitialized()`** guard to ensure client is created only when env vars are valid.

### Rich Error Mapping
* Differentiates:
  * Duplicate-email / existing account → “An account with this email already exists…”
  * Network failures → “Unable to reach authentication server…”
  * Generic fallback remains.

### Data Integrity & UX Improvements
* Ensures profile defaults (subscription, favorites) are set immediately after sign-up.
* Short delay (`500 ms`) after sign-up lets DB trigger create `profiles` row before control returns.

---

## 3 · Auth Context & Provider Fix (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

* **ReferenceError resolved** – added top-level getters (`error`, `isLoading`, `isAuthenticated`) alongside `authState`.
* Interface, defaultContext, and provider all updated consistently, eliminating the **“Property ‘error’ doesn’t exist”** runtime crash.
* All auth actions (`login`, `register`, etc.) route through the updated service for unified handling.

---

## 4 · Register Screen UX (`src/screens/Auth/RegisterScreen.tsx`)

* New **role selection** UI (Attendee / Dealer) passed through to the service.
* Enhanced error dialogs:  
  * Duplicated account → offer to **Sign In**.  
  * Offline state → instruct user to check internet.  
  * Clean fallback for unknown errors.
* Calls `clearError()` when navigating to prevent stale messages.

---

## 5 · Dependencies Added

| Package | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `@react-native-community/netinfo` | Detect real-time connectivity for graceful offline handling. |
| `dotenv` | Load `.env` variables inside `app.config.js` during Expo build. |

_All packages installed and linked; no native changes required under Expo SDK 50._

## 6 · Developer Steps to Verify

1. **Create `.env`** from `.env.example` with valid Supabase keys.  
2. `npm install` (ensures NetInfo & dotenv are present).  
3. `npm start` → Register a new user **online** → should succeed with confirmation toast.  
4. Attempt to register same email again → should prompt “Account Already Exists”.  
5. Disable network → registration/login shows “No Internet Connection” alert.  
6. Run the app: no red-box for `AuthProvider` error.

---

## 7 · Outcome

* Eliminated all reported authentication failures:
  * **Network request failed / AuthRetryableFetchError**
  * **ReferenceError in AuthProvider**
* Added proactive diagnostics preventing future mis-configurations.
* Improved user feedback, stability, and code maintainability.

## 8 · **Login Error-Handling Fix** (`LoginScreen.tsx` + `AuthContext.tsx`)

### Issue  
When a user attempted to sign-in with **incorrect credentials** the Supabase
SDK returned `AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials`.  
Although the error was caught, the `LoginScreen` surfaced the raw object and
the `AuthProvider` attempted to read a non-existent `error` property, producing

```
Warning: ReferenceError: Property 'error' doesn't exist
```

This unhandled exception crashed the app.

### Fixes  
| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **`LoginScreen.tsx`** | • Normalised error extraction – uses `err.message` first.<br>• Displays friendly **“Login Failed”** alert when credentials are wrong.<br>• Leaves verification-required logic intact. |
| **`AuthContext.tsx`** | • Added `error`, `isLoading`, `isAuthenticated` getters in context and default object – prevents “Property ‘error’ doesn’t exist” crash. |

### Validation Steps
1. Launch app → attempt login with a **wrong password**.  
2. Observe **toast / alert**: “Login Failed – Please check your credentials…”.  
3. App **does not crash**; user remains on login screen.  
4. Successful login path unchanged.
