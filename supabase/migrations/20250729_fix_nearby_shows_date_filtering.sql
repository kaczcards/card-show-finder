-- Migration: 20250729_fix_nearby_shows_date_filtering.sql
-- Description: Fixes the date filtering logic in nearby_shows functions to properly
-- return shows that are ACTIVE/RUNNING during the date range, not just shows that
-- START within the date range.
--
-- PROBLEM: The current function only returns shows where start_date is within the 
-- specified range, missing shows that:
--   1. Started before the range but are still running
--   2. Span across the entire search period
--
-- FIX: Change date filtering to include shows that:
--   1. Haven't ended before our search starts (end_date >= start_date)
--   2. Start before our search ends (start_date <= end_date)

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.nearby_shows IS 
'Finds shows within a specified radius (in miles) from a center point.
Shows are included if they are active during any part of the date range.

Date filtering logic:
- Shows that end on or after filter_start_date (haven''t ended before search starts)
- Shows that start on or before filter_end_date (start before search ends)
This captures all shows that are active during any part of the date range.

Parameters:
  lat - Latitude of the center point
  long - Longitude of the center point
  radius_miles - Radius in miles (default: 25)
  filter_start_date - Start date for filtering shows (default: current date)
  filter_end_date   - End date for filtering shows (default: current date + 30 days)

Returns:
  All columns from the shows table for shows within the specified radius, 
  ordered by distance (closest first).';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.nearby_shows_earth_distance IS 
'Alternative implementation using cube/earthdistance extensions.
