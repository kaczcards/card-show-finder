# ü§ñ First-Time Android Manual Upload Guide

## Why Manual Upload is Required

Google Play Store requires the **first submission to be done manually** through their web console. This is a security measure.

**After this first upload, all future updates can use `eas submit` automatically!**

    }
  }
}
```
Then rebuild: `eas build --platform android`
